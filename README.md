# Custom Music Player

Custom music player with 30 sec prev and forward.

---

This project has been written by next-js.

I inspired by video in yourube, it was a podcast player so i see that and make it one for myself.

We have custom music player that play flying from anathema if a I have an api it gonna be the music player application.

We have 30 sec forward and prev button and of course play/pause btn too.

If I want to be honest that was for fun but i like this project a lot.

I hope you enjoy.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
